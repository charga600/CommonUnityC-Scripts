# CommonUnityC-Scripts

This a repository of my commonly used scripts in Unity written in C#

These may be duplicated, modified and used commercially or otherwise freely with no restirctions but may not be claimed as your own. These are not original work and I claim no ownership over them, they are simply common, handy scripts to copy and paste.
